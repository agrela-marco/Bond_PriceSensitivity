In order to build multiple portfolios data was cleaned, merged and manipulated. Classifying industries by US SIC CODES, and used graphs to compare performance with multiple portfolios and implement it through multiple strategies

Task 1:
The Fama-French 3-factor model reveals that industry portfolios are subject to market risk (Mkt-RF), size risk (SMB), and value risk (HML). The beta for each component indicate the extent of exposure. The Mining sector has a Mkt-RF beta of 0.000066, which is reflecting sensitivity to the market fluctuations while an SMB beta of 0.000018, indicating little sensitivity to the size premium, and an HML beta of -0.000041, implying a modest negative connection with the value premium.

According to the findings, none of the industry portfolios provide a positive and statistically significant alpha. All industries, with the exception of "Non-classifiable," exhibit a negative and statistically significant alpha. The industries substantially underperformed according to the predictions of the Fama-French model.

Task 2:
