In order to build multiple portfolios data was cleaned, merged and manipulated. Classifying industries by US SIC CODES, and used graphs to compare performance with multiple portfolios and implement it through multiple strategies

Task 1:
The Fama-French 3-factor model reveals that industry portfolios are subject to market risk (Mkt-RF), size risk (SMB), and value risk (HML). The beta for each component indicate the extent of exposure. The Mining sector has a Mkt-RF beta of 0.000066, which is reflecting sensitivity to the market fluctuations while an SMB beta of 0.000018, indicating little sensitivity to the size premium, and an HML beta of -0.000041, implying a modest negative connection with the value premium.

According to the findings, none of the industry portfolios provide a positive and statistically significant alpha. All industries, with the exception of "Non-classifiable," exhibit a negative and statistically significant alpha. The industries substantially underperformed according to the predictions of the Fama-French model.

Task 2:
The momentum strategy analysis compares the 12-month and 6-month formation periods, revealing a stark contrast in performance. The 12-month strategy resulted in a 37.99% total capital gain, translating to a 2.52% average annual return, suggesting that stocks with momentum over a year continued their trend positively. However, the 6-month strategy performed poorly, with a -96.69% total capital loss and a -23.19% annual return, indicating that shorter-term momentum failed, likely due to higher volatility and market reversals. This aligns with research suggesting longer formation periods (e.g., 12 months) tend to capture sustained trends better than shorter ones, which may be more susceptible to noise and corrections. The drastic underperformance of the 6-month strategy suggests it may not be a viable approach in our dataset. Further investigation could explore whether sectoral shifts, macroeconomic conditions or specific stock behaviours influenced this divergence in returns.

Task 3:
I used a quarterly long short strategy where I invested  £150 into the industry with the best 3 months returns and shorted £150 from the industry with the worst 3 months returns. During the full data period, this was rebalanced on a quarterly basis. At the end of the development, the strategy had a total value of £ 6721.58 implying huge loss. When comparing the average annual return, around -14.18% , the momentum-based approach actually underperform in this period. On the other hand, this brings to light the dangers of systematic trading strategies, specifically because markets may indeed turn or hold against trend over the long run.
