In this project we computed bond price sensitivity relative to the YTM, built graphical visualisations to understand the relationship and analyse the findings

#Graph Analysis

#The analysis shows how Yield to Maturity (YTM) is sensitive to bond price and years to maturity. Since the bond price and YTM have an inverse relationship, as seen in the first graph, lower bond prices translate into higher yields and vice versa. In the second graph we observe that as the bond's maturity increases, YTM decreases. Now this is since the bond is trading at a discount, its price will rise to face value by maturity. While longer maturities carry default risk, the price appreciation offsets this, leading to a lower YTM. Coupon payments spread over more years also reduce the immediate return needed to match the bondâ€™s price.
